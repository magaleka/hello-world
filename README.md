# hello-world
more like "hello github here i come."

hello people of the world, my name is Dustin and my current goal in life is to work at blizzard. 
  Why you ask? Well,to make a story short at a young age I was very socialy awkward and it was World of Warcraft that helped me grow socialy. I want to help contribute to games that may do the same for other people.
    I am in my second year as a computer engineer major with no practical skill in software development and im dedicating the next year to just that.
